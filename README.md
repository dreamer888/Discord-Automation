# Discord Automation
#### _Project #3_
- An automated program to login and send messages to Discord using **_Selenium_** and **_PyAutoGUI_**

- This program was developed to help me automatically play **EPIC RPG** - a game in Discord, by using commands as messages in Discord

- There are currently two versions of this program using different packages with different ways to use

- Check out all branches for more details of each version

- The syntax may have changed by the time you see this

- You can use this as a demonstration, a reference to create similar program

- You may change the code to make the program most suitable

## Description
- This version uses **_PyAutoGUI_**, check **_requirements.txt_** for more details

  ### Pros
  * Simpler and errors are less likely to occur as the process is shorter

  ### Cons
  * Must stay in Discord web/app and cannot use any other applications at the same time because **_PyAutoGUI_** automatically send messages to the active chat bar without selecting

## How to use
- Run **_main.py_** and switch to the channel in Discord web/app where you play this game
