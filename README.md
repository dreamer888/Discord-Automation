# Discord Automation
#### _Project #3_
- An automated program to login and send messages to Discord using **_Selenium_** and **_PyAutoGUI_**

- This program was developed to help me automatically play **EPIC RPG** - a game in Discord, by using commands as messages in Discord

- There are currently two versions of this program using different packages with different ways to use

- Check out all branches for more details of each version

- The syntax may have changed by the time you see this

- You can use this as a demonstration, a reference to create similar program

- You may change the code to make the program most suitable

## Description
- This version uses **_Selenium_**, check **_requirements.txt_** for more details

  ### Pros
  * Can use multiple applications at the same time without affecting the automated program

  ### Cons
  * Errors are more likely to occur
  * More personalized, complex, and complicated as the process is longer

## How to use
- Create a text file in the same directory named **_account.txt_** to store your email and password

- First line is your email/username and second line is your password

- Make sure to install appropriate version of **_ChromeDriver_**

- Run **_main.py_**
