# Discord Automation
#### _Project #3_
- An automated program to login and send messages to Discord using **_Selenium_**

- This program was developed to help me automatically play **EPIC RPG** - a game in Discord, by using commands as messages in Discord

- The syntax of **_Selenium_** or **_Python_** may have changed by the time you see this

## How to use
- Create a text file in the same directory named **_account.txt_** to store your email and password

- First line is your email/username and second line is your password

- You can use this as a demonstration, a reference to create similar program

- You may change the code to fit your character and make the program most suitable
