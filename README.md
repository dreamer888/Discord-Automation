# Discord Automation
#### _Project #3_
- An automated program to login and send messages to Discord using **_Selenium_**

- This program was developed to help me automatically play **EPIC RPG** - a game in Discord, by using commands as messages in Discord

- You can also make an automated program similar to this one using **_Selenium_**

- This is a demonstration, a reference

- The syntax of **_Selenium_** or **_Python_** may have changed by the time you see this
